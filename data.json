The general waste bin has a cover, which may discourage students from lifting it due to hygiene concerns, potentially leading to improper disposal. A more sustainable option would be to replace this bin with the open-top design seen in the third image, making waste disposal easier and more efficient."

An evacuation chair like this contributes to campus sustainability by enhancing social sustainability and emergency preparedness. It improves accessibility for all students, including those with mobility impairments, promoting equal opportunity and well-being. It also ensures that everyone can evacuate safely and efficiently during emergencies. To further improve its effectiveness, the university could organize awareness and training programs to educate staff and students on proper usage, ensuring its long-term sustainability in emergency situations."    },

The open-top design makes disposal easy and convenient for users, unlike the covered bin in the fourth image, which may discourage proper use. A possible improvement would be to add a food waste bin nearby to encourage students to properly discard food scraps when bringing their own meals to campus (Graduate Centre)."

        "description": "This water fountain is located on the engineering building ground floor. This water fountain helps reduce plastic waste and conserve resources by encouraging students to refill reusable bottles instead of buying single-use plastic ones. However, hygiene concerns may arise, as some students might still drink directly from the fountain despite the sign stating it is for refilling bottles only. This could lead to potential contamination, discouraging students from using the refill station. I recommend replacing it with a more user-friendly design, such as a touchless water refill stations, to improve hygiene and encourage sustainable water consumption."
